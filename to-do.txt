Create html boilerplate

Make sure all CSS box-model is border-box to avoid tragedies

Add container

CSS container to display:flex with set width and height and make it not shrink with flex-shrink: 0

Create javascript code to make 16x16 grid inside container
>function to create grid to use later
>To do this you have to create a x column and each column is a div that will contain each cell
>>let num = number of rows and columns
>Take a good look cause it's flexbox baby!

function createGrid() {
    por cada gridSize
    crear column
        por cada gridSize
        crear cell
}

Check if grid is working putting some borders on each element
>Add classes to each grid cell and on CSS give them these borders
>These classes will work later for Javascript manip

>Javascript event mouseenter every square to change color when hovered on 
>Make sure it stays on
> Decide to use .class or backgorundColor

/Add button that will generate new grid
>Click event makes prompt appear asking for input
>Input number = new grid side
>Input should be <= 100
>Old grid disappears and generates new grid

Extra:
Randomize each square color
Add CSS for class to randomize background color (do this in CSS not Javascript!)
Each subsequent pass of mouse darkens the background color 10% until black at 10 passes
Javascript that? or CSS? seems like javascript.....
